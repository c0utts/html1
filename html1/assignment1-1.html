    <p>Mission statement: I aim to make a website where people can "purchase" or learn more about theoretical apple products.</p>
    <h1> Three goals: </h1>
    <h3> Goal 1: </h3>
    <p>Goal one is to make a clean website that  is easy to navigate.</p>
    <h3> Goal 2: </h3>
    <p>Goal two is to clearly demonstrate content in an easily digestable layout.</p>
    <h3> Goal 3: </h3>
    <p>Third goal is to create an enjoyable experience for user.</p>
    <h2> Model Site</h2>

    <h4> Will need 4 pages including: Home Page, Mac Book page, Iphone Page, an Information/About page</h4>
    <p> For the Home page I will need a very sleek and clean layout that is easy to navigate. With clear instructions on where to go for what you're looking for.</p>
    <p> For the Mac Book page I will need an easy to digest layout. Simple design that includes pictures, price and specs in a clear manor.</p>
    <p> For the Iphone page I will need a near identical page as the macbook. Clean simple that scrolls with pictures and specs of various models.</p>
    <p> For the Information/About page will just need into on why I chose this website. With some background information.</p>
    <h5> Target audience is anyone in the market to purchase a new laptop or phone. OR someone looking for more info/specs on the products.</h5>
